This was my initial planning structure based on the game-scope-study including user stories:

******************************************************************************************

gameboard: Array of 9 in JS Using Divs in HTML and CSS with respective borders to emulate proper game board. Classes and IDs will need to be used. user login: object (using JSON and Ajax) user info: object (using JSON and Ajax) player win status: boolean X game piece: string (large font styling with google fonts) O game piece: string (large font styling with google fonts)

How you will take the markup of the game board and represent it in JS

I will create a gameboard as an array. The visual gameboad will be created in HTML and CSS using divs with their respective borders. The squares will utilize classes and IDs to be used in HTML, CSS, and JS. I plan to loop through the array to populate the value of each index, based on user actions.

How you plan to approach this project.

I plan to use all the resources available to me. My fellow classmates and consulatants as well as google, w3 schools, MDN and appropriate lessons from class. I will start with HTML and CSS (Keeping it very simple initially and adding details once JS logic is complete.) There are also working examples of this project online that I can use as a reference if needed.

4-8 user stories for your game project.

As a player I want to be able to start a new game As a player I want to be able to quit a game. As a player, I can login with a username/pw As a player, I can restart the game without reloading the page. As a player I want to be able to change my account password

How you plan to keep your code modular.

Seperate my HTML, CSS and JS into their own files, linking them appropriately. I will use as many files as necesary to ensure proper sepration of code and logic. I will also keep server-side logic and client-side seperate.

What creative spin will you add to your project?

Possibly some animation. Maybe the prospect of tie breakers in order to comeplete a game?? Still working on this.

How will you use version control to backup / track your project?

Commiting often to ensure that I can rollback to previous builds if need be

Do you plan to attempt any of the bonuses?

If time permits, yes.

Problem Solving Strategy/development proccess:

My strategy was to break things down into bit size pieces. Debugging was my main issue and slowly throughout the project I was more and more thorough with this. I utlilized all available resources such as colleagues and consultants and used google, w3 schools, stack overflow etc.

Unsolved issues:

I believe i was able to meet all requirements. That said, I would really like to clean up my code and make it more modular. I would also like to utilize loops rather than if/else statements to make my code a bit more DRY.
