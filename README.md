The goal of this project was to create a working game of tic-tac-toe built with a custom game engine that will allow a user to play games, and view game statistics.

Win status is determined by a boolean value that is set to a default of false. Once a user wins a game, the boolean value becomes true and a new game can be started.

This project utilizes AJAX to interact with the back end API. Event handling was completed using jQuery.

The gameboard was created as an array. The visual gameboad was created in HTML and CSS using divs with their respective borders. The squares utilize classes and data attributes to be accesed in CSS, and JS.

In order to keep this project modular and DRY, loops were used to determine game logic and file were appropriately placed and required using Node.js import/export ability.

Version control was achieved by commiting regularly and ensuring that proper branches were utilized when working on a specific feature.

Problem Solving Strategy/development proccess:

My strategy was to break things down into bite size pieces. Debugging was my main issue and slowly throughout the project I was more and more thorough with this. I utlilized all available resources such as colleagues and consultants as well as google, w3 schools and stack overflow.

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, JS, jQuery, JSON, AJAX, Git, GitHub, Grunt, Rails, Sass Bootstrap.
